This transcript is a news segment from **NBC News Now**, hosted by Joe Fryer and Christine Romans. It covers a range of domestic and international stories, including a high-profile missing person case, extreme weather, geopolitical negotiations, and internal friction within the Department of Homeland Security.

### **Summary**
The broadcast focuses on four primary areas: the 18-day search for **Nancy Guthrie** (mother of NBC’s Savannah Guthrie), which is utilizing advanced DNA and surveillance techniques; **extreme weather** causing avalanches in Lake Tahoe and record heat in the Southeast; **diplomatic talks** regarding the Russia-Ukraine war and Iran’s nuclear program; and a **security breach** at the U.S. Capitol. Additionally, the report highlights a growing rift within the **U.S. Coast Guard** due to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem’s focus on mass deportations over traditional search-and-rescue missions.

### **Key Points**

#### **1. The Search for Nancy Guthrie**
*   **DNA Update:** DNA found on a glove near Guthrie’s home did not match the national criminal database or DNA found inside the home.
*   **New Investigative Leads:**
    *   **Genetic Genealogy:** Investigators are turning to public DNA databases to find relatives of the suspect.
    *   **Physical Evidence:** Police are tracking a "very unique" gun holster and a potential signet ring visible under the suspect's glove in surveillance footage.
    *   **Retail Surveillance:** Investigators are working with Walmart, using their advanced marketing and loss-prevention camera systems to track the suspect's purchases.
*   **Case Status:** Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos insists the case is "not cold," with hundreds of officers chasing thousands of leads.

#### **2. Extreme Weather and Natural Disasters**
*   **West Coast:** An "atmospheric river" has dumped 40+ inches of snow in the Sierra Mountains. An avalanche near Lake Tahoe trapped a group of skiers; 6 of 15 have been rescued so far.
*   **Southern California:** Los Angeles is under evacuation warnings for potential mudslides and flooding.
*   **National Contrast:** While the West faces storms, the Plains and Southeast are seeing record warmth, with temperatures in the mid-to-high 70s in Dallas and Atlanta.

#### **3. International Relations and Peace Talks**
*   **Russia-Ukraine:** Mediated by U.S. Special Envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, talks in Geneva reportedly yielded "meaningful progress." However, President Zelenskyy expressed concern over U.S. pressure to compromise on territory.
*   **Iran Nuclear Program:** Progress is reported in curb-talks, but the Trump administration has signaled that military action remains an option if a deal isn't reached, ordering a second aircraft carrier to the region.

#### **4. Capitol Hill Security Breach**
*   **The Incident:** An 18-year-old from Georgia was arrested after rushing toward the Capitol with a loaded shotgun.
*   **The Gear:** The suspect was wearing a tactical vest and gloves and had a gas mask and Kevlar helmet in his vehicle.
*   **Outcome:** No injuries occurred; the suspect complied with orders to drop his weapon. Congress was not in session at the time.

#### **5. Internal Tensions at DHS/Coast Guard**
*   **Policy Shift:** Secretary Kristi Noem has reportedly shifted the Coast Guard’s priority from its traditional "Search and Rescue" mission to "Mass Deportation" efforts.
*   **Reported Incidents:** Sources claim a search for a missing Coast Guardsman was interrupted to use the aircraft for migrant transport.
*   **Morale Issues:** Reports indicate "terrible" morale at Coast Guard headquarters, punctuated by an incident where Chief of Staff Corey Lewandowski allegedly tried to fire a pilot mid-air over a dispute regarding the Secretary’s personal luggage.

### **Insights**

*   **Technology in Forensics:** The Guthrie investigation illustrates the modern "layered" approach to crime-solving. It isn't just about fingerprinting; it involves a combination of private sector tech (Google/Nest), retail behavioral analytics (Walmart), and genetic genealogy.
*   **The "Trump Effect" on Diplomacy:** The transcript highlights a "businesslike" but high-pressure approach to foreign policy, characterized by firm deadlines (the June goal for a Ukraine deal) and military posturing (aircraft carriers near Iran) to force movement at the negotiating table.
*   **Institutional Identity Crisis:** The rift in the Coast Guard suggests a significant cultural clash. Military and first-responder organizations often struggle when their "core mission" (saving lives) is secondary to "political missions" (border enforcement/deportation), leading to the reported split between leadership and rank-and-file members.
*   **Security Readiness:** The quick apprehension of the Capitol gunman despite Congress being out of session suggests that the heightened security posture established in recent years has become a highly efficient "new normal" for Capitol Police.
