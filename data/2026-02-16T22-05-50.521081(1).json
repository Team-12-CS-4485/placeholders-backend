Now, they are a luxury product that cost about $50,000, nearly 30% higher than just a few years ago. Affordable vehicles, especially those below the price of $20,000, have nearly disappeared. And while Automakers pulled in record profits in 2023, slim margins combined with deep investments into EV batteries, software and other technology is making it hard to produce cars much cheaper. Chinese automakers can, but they're impeded by tariffs and rules. Insiders say that is just a bandage - automakers need to compete.\n\nThe HEMI name is one of the strongest names in the history of the brands collectively known under the Chrysler and MOPAR names - Jeep, Dodge, Chrysler, and the RAM Trucks brand. The 5.7 liter HEMI V8 was especially important to RAM, as the company learned the hard way. Dropping the engine in an effort to get greener cost the company at least 30,000 customers annually. Sales fell every quarter after the company replaced the HEMI with the smaller Hurricane inline 6-cylinder–even though that engine has higher horsepower and torque numbers than the HEMI. So RAM buckled and brought back the engine. The whole saga is another example of the kinds of trouble the American Chrysler brands faced after they merged with Peugeot to form Stellantis.\n\nThe Chrysler name was once one of the most recognizable in the American automotive industry. A bankruptcy and two mergers later, it is just a tiny brand some fear will face extinction. Its lineup has been whittled down to two models of one vehicle – a minivan.

I shopped around quite a bit. Before I was driving a Toyota Highlander, and the prices, it went up a lot. The average car price is nearly $50,000, a 30% increase over the past five years. Even so, automakers have resisted making cheaper ones. The Hemi is an icon. Even if you don't know what a Hemi is. You know the term, oh, it's got a Hemi. But in an effort to get greener, Ram's then newly-formed parent dropped it in favor of a high-powered twin-turbo inline six. Since its launch, Ram sales declined every quarter from Q1 2024 through the same quarter of 2025. Chrysler, once an industrial giant, is a shell of a brand. Chrysler was meant to be the luxury vehicle, but sometime in the 80s, that notion was destroyed. It just wasn't getting the attention and the investment that it deserved. The average car price is nearly $50,000, a 30% increase over the past five years. Basic automobile is $50,000 or more. Monthly payments are also close to an all time high. There are plenty of cars and models that are going for more than $100K. A record number of owners are underwater - paying more on their loans than their vehicles are worth. Even so, automakers have resisted making cheaper ones. Margins are slim and costs are high. Chinese cars are cheap, but those are getting slapped with tariffs. Insiders say U.S. carmakers can't depend on protectionism. They'll have to cut costs and sell cheaper. Even without government support, Chinese firms have big advantages. We tried to lay out that it's not evolutionary change, like you actually have to make quantum change to the organization, culture and approach to be able to achieve that. Americans are paying more for nearly everything than they were a few years ago. But car prices have outpaced even inflation. They're off pandemic era highs, but not by a lot. What do you think about how car prices have been over the last few years? They're astronomical. But I mean, the technology keeps advancing. Technology isn't free. I shopped around quite a bit before I was driving a Toyota Highlander, and the prices had went up a lot, and it was not all electric. And I wanted to move to something more environmentally friendly. So I went with the Tesla. Oh my goodness. I was trying to repurchase a Camry and using the prices. That I had from ten years ago, and it just wasn't. Yeah, it wasn't the same. So what does the industry consider an affordable car? According to the center for Automotive Research, it would cost about $25,000. The average US household spends about 15% of income on transportation. That's everything car gas, maintenance and so on. So about 51% of the population can reasonably afford a loan on a $25,000 car at 8% interest for 48 months. If you extend the term of the loan, the percentage goes up from there. The issue is there are very few cars at that price. Prior to 2018, cars that sold for less than $20,000 made up about a fifth of the market. Since then, they have all but vanished. A few models might start there, but no car sold in September 2024 had an average sticker price below $20K. Only six are below $25,000. Meanwhile, models and sales of new cars over $60,000 have soared. You're selling directly to people who want a lot of bells and whistles, and so there isn't a lot of direct targeting of people who would want a small, cheap car. This might be a strategic mistake. Here's how they got so expensive. Factor one: the continued rise of the sport utility vehicle. They went from about 30% of sales in 2009 to over 50% in 2019. Americans just love big cars. When Ford released the now discontinued subcompact EcoSport SUV, it said the average price would be $4,500 higher than Ford would get from the Fiesta, even though the SUV and the car shared the same platform. Second factor: priorities changed. The legacy automakers in the US have been pretty explicit about we are going for profits, we are not going for volume, and so we are going to sacrifice volume if it gives us a bigger margin, and that's a different strategy than they followed in the past. GM has become known for this strategy, especially under current CEO Mary Barra. Fiat Chrysler, now Stellantis, was very early to cutting high volume, but low profit, vehicles like sedans. In 2023, profits at GM and Ford were the highest in at least a decade, and Stellantis reported a record. Many global automakers have enjoyed similar gains. General Motors, for example, has these activist investors sitting on their board, and they don't buy back billions of dollars worth of stock. You know, Mary Barra could be out of a job. And so it's forces a more short term calculation than she might want. But automakers have had to make investments in technology that they weren't certain would pay off, like EVs, software defined vehicles, advanced safety, driver assistance, and autonomous driving. That money has to come from somewhere. The one meaningful way to make that transition from a financial standpoint is to create a highly profitable internal combustion engine business, and continue to manage those profits while you reduce the number of vehicles. And so you have to continue to make good profits. To generate the free cash flow, you need to feed the EV ever hungry side of the business. The trouble for automakers the business is not that profitable compared with others. About 70% of a vehicle's price goes to the direct cost of producing it. Tough. This smart can only be called F-150. About 20% to 25% goes to marketing and everything else. That leaves a 5% to 10% profit. Third factor: the coronavirus pandemic, production shutdowns, supply chain shortages and other constraints tightened supply. Dealers raised prices. Then automakers did. Affordability plummeted. Remember, the story has been for much of the last six months. You either cut price or you cut volume. And they've decided they're not cutting price. But profits come at the cost of increasingly alienated customers. Automakers meet with their dealerships on a regular basis, and particularly they do this every January at one specific gathering. And the news that came out of that gathering last year was dealerships were saying, please send us more things that we can profitably sell for less. I guess that's the message they're getting from people walking in the door. So the question is, how do American automakers get those prices down? There is some wind at their backs. Evs are expected to get cheaper with time. Battery costs are falling faster than forecasted. With big drops to come. New, stronger forms of steel may allow carmakers to use less. The simple skateboard platforms EVs are built on are easily adapted to vehicles of different sizes, spreading out costs. The Chevrolet Equinox, GM's least expensive EV, is about $300,000 less than the Cadillac Celestiq, GM's priciest. But they use the same platform. New manufacturing methods can help, too. Tesla said its proposed but not yet implemented unboxing method can cut costs in half and factory size by nearly that much. Automakers might also partner and consolidate. Two companies can share production lines and make similar cars with different brands. One can contract with another to build vehicles. For a country where the first has no presence. It could be a bid setting up shop in Mexico, having a partnership with one of the US carmakers or brands, and then they sell vehicles here with the appropriate sharing of of the final assembly costs. On the policy side, helper says regulatory certainty is another necessary condition for cheaper EVs stability and predictability around incentives, subsidies and public private partnerships. US rules change frequently, which makes it harder for companies to plan. In contrast, when China went forward on EVs, it stuck with the policy. The country has even benefited from unstable policies in the US. The cheap lithium iron phosphate batteries that contributed to China's dominance were actually created in the US by a company with a Department of Energy grant. But then, gas was really cheap. Policies were not consistently applied. They went bankrupt. They were bought very, very cheaply by the Chinese. I mean, not to take away from the Chinese. They figured out how to scale it up, but they got a leg up, you know, based on American taxpayer research. The Alliance for American Manufacturing, a group formed by domestic manufacturers and the United Steelworkers union, is in favor of tariffs and subsidies and incentives to boost the domestic industry. The group wants to keep many of the current policies in place. We're trying to gradually make a transition to new types of energy run vehicles, whether it's electric, hybrid, other sorts of technologies as well, and we're trying to offset some of the capital costs that are involved with that. And there's a long tradition of doing that in the United States. Policies can only help so much. At the end of the day, it's demand that dictates the business. It's the marketplace that makes the calls, as we all know. And so you can have some amount of demand side subsidies, like you get $7,500 off if you buy this EV with the certain mix up to a certain point. But these things cost a lot of taxpayer dollars, as we all know. This is the challenge Chinese competition poses. Critics say Chinese cars are cheap because they are heavily subsidized by the government. There are other factors. Wages are really low. There's a fair amount of evidence of forced labor in part of the battery supply chain. There's also a lot less attention to environmental considerations in terms of cleaning up and having a clean battery operation, which uses a lot of nasty chemicals. That said, the best of the Chinese EV startups have a 30% cost advantage over legacy automakers even without subsidies or government help. Mark Wakefield, a managing director for AlixPartners, says to compete with that, automakers have to completely change the way they operate. From an automaker's perspective, you can't count on that protectionism. You have to get ready to fight. This is the hard part. First, Chinese companies are software oriented. Established automakers elsewhere produce cars made with very limited software embedded in parts. Truly software defined vehicles, in contrast, are ones where hardware and software can be updated independently, more like computers. It's fundamentally different way of developing a vehicle. Chinese firms are also fast. They develop things quickly. They scale things quickly, which attracts attention from government, suppliers or other stakeholders. They take out a lot of time in the strategic phase. They're much more willing to just go. They don't have the same sort of battles about what to do and what to make. Chinese firms rely heavily on methods like virtual testing, rather than the physical tests favored by others. This cuts months off schedules and hundreds of millions of dollars from budgets. They have a shorter time to market. Non-chinese brands take about 5.4 years to develop a new model. Legacy Chinese brands 3.5. New energy vehicle brands like BYD, 1.6. Deadlines are hard, even if that means releasing a subpar vehicle. These companies have an intense overtime culture. Most of them do not allow this drift that Western companies do, and they're willing to put a bad vehicle out there and suffer the consequences because they consider the alternative to be a guaranteed loss. If I take 40 months to make the vehicle, I can't make a competitive vehicle. They're also willing to endure large losses early as they get to scale. There are two benefits higher volumes which help spread costs, but also a lot of learning in that painful early period. This desire for short term profits by American investors, these activist investors, makes that strategy hard. China has taken large losses for a long time, and this is their playbook. They do this in industry after industry. There's very little forgiveness for a CEO today who says they make losses on a vehicle or a vehicle line or a whole new propulsion technology. And so they're questioned every quarter. And so they're thinking of it every day. And so it's in that sense where if you now move from a $60,000 vehicle or a $70,000 vehicle or a $40,000 vehicle to now suddenly announcing affordable vehicles at $25,000, you get doubly questioned because you're going to be making even more of a loss per vehicle. They also take a first principles approach, a willingness to question some of the most basic assumptions or practices. Tesla has been known for this in the US market, for example, allowing over-the-air updates to the core safety and powertrain systems on the vehicle, things like brakes and motors. For they did that, and even probably seven years after they did it, no other auto company in the world would. Vertical integration--doing a lot of work in-house rather than outsourcing to suppliers also seems to be a key advantage for companies like Chinese BYD and American Tesla. The United States is also investing in a local EV supply chain. In terms of money spent, it's gone from trailing China to surpassing it. Implementing these changes may be hard. China's regulatory environment and customer base is totally different from the United States, but closing that 30% cost gap might require a total revamp. It feels like you can't do these in small little bits and pieces and evolution, and you can't do it by just telling people, hey, behave differently. You know, you need the systems, you need the organizational structure and the incentives, and you need different power centers and what keystone's people are going to consider to be sacrosanct versus changeable. In 2005, Chrysler sold 649,293 cars spread across seven models. Historically, it has been one of the most recognizable names in the US auto industry one third of the so-called Big Three, the three major American automakers. Now, 20 years later, the brand has nearly disappeared. The only vehicle it currently makes is a minivan. Fortunately, it was...The heyday was 20 years ago and more. And over time, it just wasn't getting the attention and the investment that it deserved. An enthusiast news outlet summed it up by saying Chrysler, once an industrial giant, is a shell of a brand. It is now just one of 14 brands in the stable of Stellantis, a struggling European American automaker. Top managers had said they would consider killing brands that aren't meeting targets. One of founder Walter P Chrysler's heirs fears that Chrysler could be one of them. I've seen the brand slowly whittle away over the years, but I feel I'm on a mission to protect some very important, iconic brands, part of American history that we do not want to lose. Chrysler says at least three new vehicles are on the way, including an updated version of its only product. Chrysler brand is here to stay. It is being well invested in. The brand is not on the table for elimination, and it has a very bright future. Chrysler is one of the four brands that used to make up what once was known as the Chrysler Corporation. There have been others throughout its long history. Examples: Plymouth, Eagle, DeSoto. Companies like Chrysler have a foothold and a significance in the history of industry in the United States of America. Like it's a foundational company, it's one of the companies... They pioneered lots of different things. They were foundational in getting us to the point where we are now with personal transportation and the automotive industry as we know it. The Chrysler Corporation was, and in spite of its current European ownership, is sort of still considered one of the Big Three or Detroit Three, along with Ford and General Motors. It has had a colorful and often difficult history. Walter Chrysler founded the company and the brand. It was his intention to deliver vehicles that were beautifully designed, with thoughtful innovation in features and top notch engineering and quality, all at affordable price. It nearly went bankrupt in 1980 and then actually did in 2009. To be fair, so did General Motors, fellow D3 giant. Chrysler has been owned by a private equity firm, by Mercedes Benz, by Italian maker Fiat, and in 2021, it merged with French maker Groupe PSA to form Stellantis. The latest arrangement has suffered turmoil. After a record year of profits in 2023, the dealers that sell the North American brands sent an open letter severely criticizing management, especially CEO Carlos Tavares. Not long after, Tavares suddenly resigned. Despite their challenges, over the decades, these brands have managed to endure and even succeed. The thing that comes across is, is that ability to develop, to develop products that are consistent with the DNA and Jeep and and Ram and Dodge are doing that really well. But Chrysler was never able to carve out a similar niche. Its only models in production are the Voyager and Pacifica--basically different versions of the same product. Chrysler is credited with mainstreaming these vehicles and is leading the segment, but minivans are all but disappearing from the market. In addition, the minivans are made in Ontario, Canada, and the incoming Trump administration is threatening a 25% tariff on all products imported from the country. Chrysler told CNBC it is looking forward to working with the president elect. Sales have increased since the pandemic and the segment is targeting some new buyers. Empty nesters, single people and couples with pets. Young people who are very outdoor active. I'm proud to say that when I came into leading the brand in 2021, we recaptured segment leadership and we've held that for the last three and a half years. Chrysler was meant to be a premium or near-luxury brand, but its problem was that some of its recent owners decided its stablemates did a better job of serving that market. The Chrysler was meant to be the luxury vehicle. So think about Lincoln and Cadillac. And that's what Chrysler was meant to be. But sometime in the in the 80s, that notion was destroyed. Right. And so Chryslers were just rebadged Plymouths and, you know, Dodges and nothing special about them. And recovering that became very difficult because it had persisted for a long time. If you want to look at the cars that that corporation makes now that are the closest to being luxury cars, they're Jeeps, you know, they're the Wagon--the Grand Wagoneer. Apart from the Jeep strategy, after Fiat bought the company out of bankruptcy in 2009, it sought to position its European brands, especially Maserati and Alfa Romeo, as the new company's main premium and luxury names. Chrysler's reputation for poor quality didn't help. Even if you made a Chrysler that was really like, in every way an engineer could go over it with a fine tooth comb and say, man, this is every bit as good as a Mercedes, people wouldn't pay as much as they'll pay for a Mercedes, because they'll have a Chrysler badge on it. And they're going to be like, well, you know, what are my neighbors going to say about that? Of course, some say these strategies haven't worked out all that well either. Alfa Romeo sold fewer than 7000 cars in the U.S. through the third quarter of 2024. Some blame Jeep's sales declines on its aggressive move up market. It wasn't always like this. The 90s and 2000 were good years for Chrysler. In the 90s the Chrysler brand really benefited from, you know, sort of an overall revival at Chrysler Corporation. Bold, risk taking, a little outlandish. We're talking about the same broader company that made the Prowler. I mean, who makes an open wheel hot rod, retro looking thing in the middle of...They did. That was risk taking. The Hellcat is risk taking. That's the kind of thing that needs to come back in order for people to look to Chrysler again. The PT Cruiser's retro styling polarized opinion, inspiring both ridicule and devotion. Still, it sold well 1.3 million during its ten-year run. But there were also more conventional vehicles, such as the Chrysler 300, which in 2005 sold nearly, as well as the Jeep Liberty, a high volume midsize SUV, and nearly twice as well as the Wrangler. That was a car that really just took the market, by storm. I mean, everybody had to have one. Cars like the 300 embody what many argue was Chrysler's true identity, an affordable combination of upscale design and performance. They brought us to a point where we started to equate power with luxury, and I think that's still true. Founder Walter P. Chrysler, who had already built a reputation as a kind of turnaround executive at brands such as Buick and Willys-Overland, began working with some ex-Studebaker engineers in 1920. The plan: make affordable luxury cars. Their first, the 1924 Chrysler Six,came with a pretty modest sticker price. Walter also had four children. Frank Rhodes is the grandchild of one of the daughters. A very die-hard Chrysler person. It was like six months before she passed away. I think Chrysler was going bankrupt at the time. And she says, do what you can to keep the engine running. And that's all I've been doing ever since. In August 2024, Rhodes wrote an open letter to Stellantis saying he wanted to acquire the Chrysler, Dodge and Mopar brands. I don't have an actual monetary proposal. I just want to see what Stellantis is going to do and what the executives are going to do to make this right for our country and keep these brands alive. This is an American icon. He was planting a seed or making a suggestion that if the intention was to not invest in Chrysler or Dodge going forward, that perhaps another path could be an investor group purchasing the brands from Stellantis and making sure that they live on for the future. But I can assure you that both brands have a really bright future in the Stellantis portfolio. In a public statement, Stellantis said none of its brands are for sale. Rumors and reports of Chrysler's potential demise have circulated as its lineup has shrunk and sales slowed. I just wanted to set the record straight and bust some of those myths that Chrysler's future is intact. It's being invested in, and we will continue to grow the brand for the foreseeable future. To illustrate what lies ahead, Chrysler has unveiled some concept vehicles over the last two years--a 2022 crossover called the Airflow, which will not be going into production, and in 2024, a sporty coupe called the Halcyon. We found a new audience for a really cool, sporty-looking coupe. And if you take a look at the design elements of that vehicle, both on the exterior and interior, it is very much the direction that our future design language is going in across the entire portfolio. So very modern, sleek, not overly complicated in terms of design cues and elements, but just very clean. As far as the Halcyon goes. Well, that to me is just smacking of pure concept car fancy. I mean, you know, it's got a fully full glass cockpit, you know, kind of like a jet fighter. I mean, pretty much all of it is unfeasible for an actual real production car. But Chrysler did say some kind of production version is in the works. I mentioned the Halcyon concept that we are working on bringing to market, and a real industrialized form that's affordable for customers as well. In the short term, it is focusing on the Pacifica and Voyager minivans. A refreshed Pacifica in 2026 with a new exterior design. The powertrain on that will be an updated version of the plug-in hybrid system on the current model, one shared with the Jeep four by E models. A full battery EV minivan will come out later. The company didn't specify a date. Chrysler will still offer the 3.6L gas version through the end of the decade. In 2026. It also plans to release a large crossover that will come out in both fully electric and hybrid versions. The company is confident the new lineup will help repair the relationship with dealers that has plagued all the American Stellantis names. We've shown the silhouettes and the properties to dealers, and they just cannot wait to get these products on their lots. We've also done market research with consumers, because we wanted to make sure that this new direction that we're taking Chrysler brand in is going to meet their expectations, and their jaws just dropped at how beautiful the cars look. And they were literally saying, if this is the direction that Chrysler is going in. Sign me up. I think going forward, it's critical for Chrysler to regain some of that spirit of outlandishness and emotion. And, you know, these were these Chrysler products that we've been talking about. These are all products that really hit people in the feels. In the world of American muscle cars, SUVs, and pickups, the HEMI is an icon. A big, loud eight cylinder engine found in many of the vehicles collectively known by the Mopar or Chrysler names. Hey. This ain't got a HEMI. Yeah, sweet. Even if you don't know what a HEMI is, you know the term. Oh, it's got a HEMI. It's associated with a muscle car. Era of the 60s. Obviously, there were a lot of very iconic, very powerful, very fast, very fun muscle cars. The HEMI was especially important to Stellantis profitable pickup brand, Ram. But in an effort to get greener, Ram's then newly formed parent dropped it in favor of a high powered twin turbo inline six. The engine is arguably superior. That didn't matter. Since its launch, Ram sales declined every quarter from Q1 2024 through the same quarter of 2025. When they feel betrayed by their brand. That brand then has to really earn that buyer back, and that can be very tough. Now, the Stellantis CEO that made that change, Carlos Tavares, is gone. Tim Kuniskis, a longtime company veteran, is back in charge at Ram. Reviving the HEMI engine has been one of his first moves. And the first day we opened up for him, yours, we took 12,000 orders. CNBC dove in to find out why this engine is such a big deal. What this saga says about the bigger problems at Stellantis, and why big gas burning engines still have a place in an electrifying market. Up until 2019, Ram was a growing threat to rivals in the ever important and highly profitable North American pickup truck market. After Chrysler was brought out of bankruptcy through its merger with Italian carmaker Fiat Ram, like its Chrysler Corporation stablemates, experienced something of a renaissance. Ram trucks We eclipsed the volume of a Chevy Silverado and got close to F-150. It is one MotorTrend truck of the year seven times since becoming a standalone brand. It also took home the prestigious North American Truck of the year award twice, last in 2019. It ranked high on various J.D. power lists, such as initial quality and driver appeal. 2019 was the year Ram's parent, Fiat Chrysler, merged with another European automaker, group PSA. This is where many say Ram and the other Chrysler Mopar brands hit choppy waters. Ram trucks never totally lost their critical appeal. The Light Duty 1500, which makes up about half of Ram's U.S. pickup truck volume, won three of its total MotorTrend Awards since 2019, including for the 2025 model year. It has also won a top award in Texas seven years in a row. Texas is about 20% of the total US truck market. The Ram 1500 is a truly outstanding truck. It has absolutely the best ride quality of any full size pickup. Also, the interior in my view, probably the best in the segment. Ram pickups really feel expensive. They feel like quality pieces. But over the last several years it has lost market share to rivals. Other Detroit brands have lost sales since 2016, but after hitting a peak in 2019, Ram finished 2020 for 100,000 units below where it was eight years earlier. Meanwhile, GM's premium GMC Sierra had grown by about the same number in the same time frame. Stellantis had a slew of problems, including stale product, high prices, and a lineup dealers and industry analysts said didn't fit what customers wanted. It finished 2024 with a 70% drop in profits. Its troubles trickled down to all of the American brands. Ceo Carlos Tavares also pushed hard to cut costs and green the fleet. More EVs, lower emissions. But fans and insiders say some of these measures were too swift, too severe and ignorant of the US market in America. We want cars that, you know, that make us replace the tires. Every year we think about burnouts. The wrong people were trying to guide America, American enthusiasts in a direction they did not want to go and still don't want to go. Among those moves, Stellantis briefly disbanded the American Street and Racing Technology Division, better known as SRT. It's the Chrysler Mopar version of the performance shops. Many automakers have a Chrysler Jeep, Ram or Dodge vehicle with an SRT badge on. It is a high performance one. Stellantis also spiked the V8 engine across most of its lineup, except for a handful of models. Ram's sister brand, Dodge had found a fair bit of success reviving its muscle car heritage through its Challenger and Charger, especially with eye popping versions like the Hellcat, Hellcat Redeye and the demon. It even started calling itself the Brotherhood of Muscle. Under Tavares, the Charger and Challenger were combined into a single model. But more importantly for fans, all those over-the-top V8 powered versions were gone and replaced with a new charger that came with two powertrains, one fully electric and one with an inline six engine called the hurricane. There were practically pitchforks at Stellantis headquarters when that happened. Carlos did something that wasn't appreciated. You know, they lost a lot of fan base because they went to electric. I've driven the hurricane. It's a very nice engine. It's very refined. It's very smooth, which on paper it's better in every way. Well, it better in many ways. Yes. On paper. The standard engine has more horsepower and more torque than the HEMI. And the high output six blows the V8 out of the water. It is a fantastic offering, but there are some people that they count cylinders. They want the HEMI. They want the V8, they want the sound of that naturally aspirated V8. They want the rumble. They want the drama. Americans associate truck performance with V8 engines. The ramp customer in particular really, really, really loves the idea of having that big American V8 under the hood. You take away what made them love the brand and love the trucks to begin with. Um, well, yeah, they're going to revolt. I grew up with tuner. I, you know, inline six Toyota supers are awesome, but when you start trying to stuff, you know, a inline six twin turbo into a very heavy vehicle. You're you're not going to get the same performance as a very torquey V8. When the 25 model debuted in quarter one of 2024, sales dropped off a cliff. Here's what that looked like. These choices really cost the brand customers, which in the truck segment you cannot afford to risk. Here's how Kuniskis put it. There are about 3.6 million people driving a Ram with a HEMI engine in it. About 6 to 8% of them buy a new truck every single year. And of that 68%, 40% of them said, I won't shop you if you don't offer that engine. They didn't say, I won't buy because I need that engine, but they said, I won't shop you unless you have the opportunity for me to look at your current offering. And what I drive today so I can compare and contrast. That's about 30,000 units a year automatically that I would have lost. And with loyalty running in 7,580% of the truck segment, you don't want to lose any of those customers. Kuniskis expects about 40% of Ram buyers sooner or later to settle on the HEMI. That's a lot higher than the Ford F-150 V8. Take rate of about 25%, but slightly lower than GM's, which Kuniskis attributes to the fact that apart from a diesel. Gm offers a choice of two V8's or a four cylinder Ford F-150. Buyers can swap in a V8 for free on most versions of the truck, Ram buyers have to pay an extra $1,200 unless they get the high end Limited or Longhorn trims. Kuniskis thinks a lot of people will choose the HEMI anyway. HEMI is not really just a V8. It's kind of a brand in and of itself. It's it's become a thing. And Ram isn't giving up on the hurricane. The reality is, as attached as some buyers are to V8, customers are choosing smaller engines. Toyota has already dropped its V8 from the tundra lineup with less pushback. You're gonna want to see what the new engine is compared to what you're used to, so you're going to want to drive them both. It's all about the choice. It's not about one versus the other. It's about having the choice. It's also not giving up on electric. Ram is planning two new EV trucks, one fully electric and another with a gas burning generator. Kuniskis was also CEO of Dodge when that brand unveiled the electric Dodge Charger. Kind of typecast with, you know, I'm the HEMI guy, I'm the supercharger guy, I'm the Hellcat guy, all that kind of stuff. And it's it's weird to hear you talk about electric vehicles. A lot of times people that bash electric vehicles have never driven one, um, electric cars, they have their faults. There's no question they have their faults, but they are fantastic. Electrification will ultimately take over. But for the time being, while gasoline engines are available, gasoline engine enthusiasts want the ultimate expressions of those gasoline engines, and a big V8 engine is certainly one of those things. They they can have electric vehicles. I won't buy one. Uh, I'm an ex Tesla employee. I've never owned an electric car, but if Dodge really wants to sell Vehicles. They have to sell customizable cars that scream drive me! We are in the very early days. 500 mile range, lighter solid state batteries, inductive charging, sufficient infrastructure and prices that are comparable to gas engines. Kuniskis is confident all these will happen. When you get there, you will get mass adoption. The problem is we tried to force mass adoption before we got there. The car displaced the horse because it was better. The electric car is going to be better. We just have a lot of challenges in the industry that we have to overcome first, and and we will overcome them. We have to, because as an industry, we've invested about a half $1 trillion in this."}, {"videoId": "Q22hihy6qcw", "title": "Why The OpenAI And Anthropic Rivalry Is Heating Up", "description": "The gloves are coming off in the high-stakes rivalry between OpenAI and Anthropic as both companies race towards potential IPOs in late-2026.

In 2026, as both OpenAI \nand Anthropic race ahead on what are poised to be \nhistoric IPOs. These AI giants are trying \nto create the fastest, smartest and best models, \nspending billions and then raising billions from \ninvestors along the way. They compete on almost every \nlevel. We've seen some signals that \nit's anything but friendly competition. The latest \nsignal a high profile spat over advertising. In January, OpenAI began \nunveiling plans to introduce ads for free users and \nChatGPT go subscribers in the United States, \nan opportunity to pull in crucial revenue as the \ncompany faces down $1.4 trillion in AI build out \ncommitments. OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar \nstressing to CNBC that the ads would not influence the \nresponses given to users. North Star is the model \nalways gives you the best answer, not the paid for \nanswer that has to remain. Goal one. We don't share \nyour conversations with advertisers. We don't sell \nyour data to advertisers. Meanwhile, Anthropic \nannouncing in no uncertain terms that its own flagship \nchatbot, Claude, would remain ad \nfree. It went a step further, \nspending millions on Super Bowl ads that never mention \nOpenAI but take clear aim at the rival lab. \"But confidence isn't just \nbuilt in the gym. Try Step Boost Max, \nthe insoles that add one vertical inch of height and \nhelp short kings stand tall. Use code height maxing ten \nfor big discounts.\" OpenAI CEO Sam Altman \npunching back on X, writing that the ads are \ndeceptive and calling Anthropic an expensive \nproduct for rich people. It's one of the most public \ndisplays yet of the animus. These two AI startups that \nhave helped define the emerging industry until now \nhad been quietly competing behind the scenes. The \ntension goes all the way back to 2020. That was when \nOpenAI's then vice president of research, Dario Amodei, \nleft, with his sister Daniela, \nand more than a dozen senior researchers. The split was \ndriven by concerns over AI safety and OpenAI's \nincreased commercialization. The Amadeus, along with five \nformer OpenAI employees, co-founded anthropic in 2021 \nas a public benefit corporation, in part to \nresist some of those pressures. But anthropic is \nnow a corporate giant itself, and the head butting \nreally comes down to competing for businesses. In early February, \nAnthropic dropped Claude 4.6 opus, and OpenAI unveiled \nits own ChatGPT 5.3 Codex. One company has been a clear \nviral standout in enterprise, the Anthropic's. Claude has emerged as one of \nthe most favored AI platforms for the \nenterprise. Anthropic comes out with \nsomething like Claude Code and Cowork that shows just \nhow powerful another model company can be. That guy Claude is very \nbusy. Destroying a lot of \ncompanies. Yeah the fanfare around \nClaude, starting just weeks after \nthe November release of Google's Gemini three, \nprompted a code red inside OpenAI. Internally, \nAltman has been telling employees that the AI giant \nreturned to monthly growth, and OpenAI is in talks to \nraise capital, which could value it at an \neye popping $800 billion. ChatGPT does lead the \nconsumer market, but winning over that core \nenterprise customer, it's going to be a crucial \nsource of revenue for both of these companies. They're \nmore profitable versus consumers paying 20 bucks a \nmonth. And businesses tend to be \nstickier, meaning there's more \nrecurring revenue. Ceo Dario Amodei has told CNBC that \nenterprise makes up 80% of Anthropic's business, \nwhile OpenAI's CFO Sarah Friar says she's aiming to \nhave a 5050 split by the end of this year. At the end of last year, \nsitting right here, I would have said our \nbusiness is 50 over 50 consumer enterprise Yeah or \nsorry, 70 over 30 consumer \nenterprise. Today that number is 60 over \n40. I think we'll end the year \ncloser to 50 over 50. OpenAI has taken a much more \naggressive tack on spending for compute, which fire also \nsays translates to revenue. Anthropic has been a bit \nmore conservative, and executives are \nincreasingly comfortable highlighting those \ndifferences. We made less flashy \nheadlines than some. You know, we've been focused \non on growing revenue and winning business rather than \nspending money and announcing the biggest \ncomputer deals that we possibly could. These companies have gone \nhead to head, raising hundreds of billions \nof dollars in private markets and to have the best \nAI models. The next leg of this race is \ntheir potential. 2026 IPOs. Anthropic and \nOpenAI could hit public markets as early as the end \nof this year, according to sources, \nbut both will debut at sky high valuations and cash \nburn investors. Both of those companies have \ntold me that they want to be the first to explain their \nstory to Wall Street. How to value these \ncompanies, how to justify some of those losses. And \none banker compared this IPO parade to the fierce \ncompetition between Uber and Lyft back in 2019. Lyft was able to list a \nmonth before Uber and then set the public market \nbenchmark despite being the smaller company. On the \nother hand, some bankers say it might be good to let your \nrival go out and test the waters first."}, {"videoId": "YpAGlWjo6a8", "title": "Trump's EPA Just Rolled Back A Key Climate Finding.

They have shareholders to answer to, not us.", "likes": 130}], "transcript": "The Trump administration \njust repealed a scientific finding that provides the \nlegal basis for the EPA to regulate climate pollution. The 2009 endangerment \nfinding concluded that six greenhouse gases threaten \npublic health and welfare by exacerbating extreme \nweather. The determination required \nthe federal government to regulate carbon dioxide, \nmethane, and other greenhouse gases \nthat are generated by the burning of oil, \ngas, and coal. It's important because it \nenables EPA to do its job to adopt standards that cuts \nthis harmful pollution and protects Americans. The reversal will remove the \nregulatory requirements for motor vehicle emissions and \nrollback related compliance programs and credit \nprovisions. It will also open the door \nfor a future repeal of power plant regulations. This action will eliminate \nover $1.3 trillion of regulatory costs and help \nbring car prices tumbling down dramatically. For Americans, \nthis means more pollution. As much as 18 billion tons \nof additional climate altering pollution. It means \nhigher costs, means Americans will spend \nup to $1.4 trillion more in fuel to power these less \nefficient and higher polluting vehicles. And for \nautomakers, it means removing a stable, \npredictable regulatory framework that has allowed \nautomakers to invest, to innovate and to compete \nglobally. The rule change will have \nthe biggest impact on the auto industry. The \ntransportation sector is the largest contributor of \ngreenhouse gas emissions in the U.S., accounting for \nabout 28% of the country's total emissions. Federal officials said that \nthe reversal could save $2,400 per vehicle, \naccording to the Wall Street Journal. But regulatory \nuncertainty can make it difficult for companies to \nplan and can threaten business stability. Things \nin the automotive industry work on like five, \nseven, sometimes even ten year timelines. You need to be able to plan \nthings out, and when regulations change \nlike this, it can really disrupt a lot \nof the plans that are already in place. In a statement, \nFord Motor Company told CNBC that they have consistently \nadvocated for a single, stable national standard \nthat aligns with customer choice, the market, \nsocietal benefit and American job growth. Removing these protections, \nthe endangerment finding clean vehicle standards, \nremoving consumer rebates that support clean vehicles \nmakes it harder to compete in a world that's globally \ncompetitive, where we see companies \nracing ahead to build the technologies of tomorrow \nthat save people money and cut pollution. The other issue is that \nautomakers work across all different kinds of markets, \nand if those markets have different regulations, \nthen they have to keep adjusting their product \nstrategy in different places to suit the local \nregulations. The more consistent the \nrules are across all the markets where an automaker \nmight operate, the better it is for them, \nbecause it gives them an opportunity to do everything \nconsistently and achieve those economies of scale \nthat help them get profitability. It remains to \nbe seen how the auto industry will respond to the \nnew rule. A lot of the automakers that \noperate in the United States operate in several different \ncountries, and a lot of those countries \nstill have emissions regulations that are quite \nstrict. And so if Ford or GM or \nToyota or whoever else wants to sell vehicles in Europe \nor Asia or Latin America or somewhere else in the world, \nand the country that they want to sell those vehicles \nin still has really strict emissions regulations, \nthey might end up just deciding that they want to \nkeep their vehicles pretty efficient across their \nentire fleet so that they're not making different \nvehicles for every different market. In the absence of \nemissions regulations at the federal level, \nstates may step up and enact their own legislation. States have played a very \nimportant role in reducing climate pollution, \nincluding from vehicles. California has adopted \nstandards that have cut pollution, saved consumers \nmoney. And so the role of states in \na world where the federal government is not taking \naction consistent with law to protect people and to \nsave people money is even greater. And so we can and \nwould expect to see action at the state level. The reversal comes at a time \nwhen the Trump administration is facing \nincreasing political pressure to improve \naffordability, including lowering energy \ncosts for consumers. With midterms approaching \n72% of Americans rate economic conditions as only \nfair or poor, and 51% of Americans say \nthey are very concerned about the price of \nelectricity, according to a Pew Research \nCenter survey. So we have indicated that if \nthe administration goes forward, as it has said it \nwill, that we will plan to to file \na legal challenge to this action. We don't think it \nwill hold up in court. We do have a clear legal \nframework here. We have a law that Congress \nhas passed, the Clean Air Act, \nthat makes clear that EPA has the authority and \nresponsibility to reduce this pollution, \nand the science is extremely clear here as well. Climate pollution hurts \npeople's health and welfare. And there are solutions that \nwe have to reduce this pollution, to make vehicles \ncleaner and to save people money. In September, \na group of attorneys general from Democrat-led states \nwrote a comment letter opposing the repeal of the \nendangerment finding. I think it's important for \npeople to understand how this really damaging action \nwill impact Americans across the country in our lives. It will mean more pollution, and it will mean more \npollution that forms smog, that exacerbates asthma, \nthat leads to premature death. Our estimates suggest \nit could lead to up to 58,000 additional premature \ndeaths by 2055, and we'll see higher costs \nthat we're forced to pay at the gas pump and across our \neconomy."}, {"videoId": "V1kBKpCQrzs", "title": "Can American Airlines Turn Itself Around?", "description": "American Airlines has promised Wall Street and travelers that 2026 will be a turnaround year.

It's been trailing its U.S. competitors, Delta Airlines \nand United Airlines in profits and reliability by a \nwide margin, and has fallen behind in the \nrace for premium air travel. The customer experience is \nreally what matters. And there is the issue goes \nback to basic tenets of what kind of business you want to \nrun. And if you don't run a reliable business, \nyou don't get repeat customers. American stock is down over \nthe last 12 months, while other major U.S. \nairlines have posted gains. So the pressure is on for \nCEO Robert Isom. We were on track really like \nwhat we saw in October in terms of bookings on track \nto have a really solid turnaround in terms of our \nfourth quarter performance. Government shutdown hit us. \nIt hit us harder than others. We're more \ndomestically focused. We've seen bookings return \nfirst three weeks of this year, our best bookings on \nrecord. And as we come and take a \nlook at this this year, 2026, we're returning to \nsolid profitability. The airline flew a similar \nnumber of passengers and flights as its close \ncompetitors last year, but its profit was a tiny \nfraction of what United and Delta reported. Its net margins were \nsignificantly narrower too. 2025 started with a tragedy \nfor American when an Army Blackhawk helicopter crashed \ninto one of its arriving regional jets, \nkilling all 67 people on the two aircraft. But American \nhas trailed its competitors for several years. The slippage began decades \nago, so it's nothing new. The issue really is the \ncompany deciding what it wants to be. I mean, \nit's a very, very basic issue. Does it want to be a global \npremium airline, full service in nature, \nor does it want to be a domestic volume oriented \nmarket price carrier? American has been lagging \nits rivals in the premium travel boom. It's a segment \nthat's become more important because first class seats \ncost more and regular coach fares have slumped. Premium travel is a segment \nwhere the airline industry is seeing strength to catch \nup to rivals. American is now investing \nmore heavily in premium products like new cabins. It plans to grow lie flat \nand premium economy seating by 50% by the end of the \ndecade. It is also revamping its \nairport lounges, and it recently forged a new \ncredit card deal with Citibank. It's even changing \nsmaller things like adding Lavazza coffee and a new \nchampagne brand. 321 XLR's are coming in. Really pleased with our \nBoeing 787-9 with the flagship suites. We've got lounge work going \non throughout the system, and that's a cornerstone of \nwhat we're doing going forward. And this is not \nwork that's just happening now. It's work that we've \ninvested in and it's really coming to fruition now. American has also dropped \nbelow rivals in reliability, angering customers and crew \nmembers. It's much, much less \nexpensive, much greater margin to do it \nright than to have to do it over. And ultimately, \nemployees pay for that, too. American's pilot and flight \nattendant unions have called Isom's leadership into \nquestion. The flight attendants union \nwent as far as passing a vote of no confidence in \nIsom, because American's profits \nwere so low. Profit sharing with staff was also small, \nupsetting key labor groups. Isom acknowledged this, \nbut did note, however, that American has \nrecently passed new contracts with flight \nattendants and other labor groups that come with higher \npay compared with their counterparts at United. Airline analysts say that \nchange will take time and the carrier will have to \nspend money to get there. Another challenge is that \nAmerican has to pay down more than $35 billion in \ndebt. American put out an upbeat \nforecast for this year. It expects both revenue and \nprofits to grow.

If a country is unreasonable to work with, work around them.  China could not be more thrilled.", "likes": 497}], "transcript": "American tariffs have dealt \na blow to Canadian auto manufacturing, and the \nCanadian government is striking deals with other \ncountries. Canada is dropping the 100% \nduty on Chinese EVs, and is allowing about 50,000 \nvehicles into the country at a tariff rate of 6.1%. This is a dramatic shift \nfrom just a few years ago. Up until 2024, \nCanada had accepted Chinese vehicles of any kind at that \nsame 6.1% tariff rate. But in 2024, following in \nthe footsteps of the US, it raised the duty on \nChinese EVs to effectively 106%. In exchange for \nreducing the duty, China said it would reduce \nits tariffs on Canadian canola oil. But in addition, the deal aims to create \njoint ventures between China and Canada that will \ngenerate jobs for Canadian workers and help build out \nthe country's EV supply chain. Canada's auto \nmanufacturing sector has been shrinking for about the \nlast quarter century, from around 3 million units \nin 2000 to 1.3 million in 2025. The introduction of \nthe US tariffs has accelerated the decline. China is not the only \ncountry Canada is striking deals with. It also signed a \nmemorandum of understanding with Korea on clean vehicle \nmanufacturing. In early February, \nthe Canadian government released a new automotive \nstrategy for the country. It restored the $5,000 \nfederal credit for electric vehicles, which had run out \nof money in 2025. The government also plans to \noffer tax credits for manufacturers in the \ncountry. But experts say that if \nCanada's relationship with the US doesn't improve, \nit's unclear if international automakers are \ngoing to want to invest in a country when it doesn't have \naccess to the US market. Domestic car sales in Canada \nare only 1.8 to 2 million units a year. New car sales \nin the US are about eight times that. Canada exports \naround 90% of the vehicles it makes overwhelmingly to \nthe US, and imports make up about \nthe same percentage of vehicles sold in the \ncountry. Under the agreement, \n49,000 Chinese EVs are permitted in Canada. Initially, that number could \nrise to 70,000 in 5 years. Even if one Chinese \nautomaker were to totally monopolize that, \nit still wouldn't be enough to justify the construction \nof a typical factory. The high fixed costs of \nmanufacturing require that a plant make a minimum of \n200,000 to 250,000 vehicles to be profitable. Given that the Canadian \ngovernment is likely to allocate shares of the total \n49,000 to different automakers, each one might \nonly sell, say, 15,000. That would \nleave a factory with a huge balance of EVs. It would be forced to sell \nsomewhere else. Where are they going to go? \nThey're not going to go to the US. Maybe they're going \nto go to Europe. Maybe they're going to go to \nthe UK. Maybe they're going to go to Mexico, \nor maybe they're going to have a global mandate, \nor maybe they won't do this at all. Officially, the US policy is \na 25% tariff on non-U.S. content on cars imported \nfrom Canada. Effectively, that works out \nto about a 10 to 12% duty on each car. It's impossible to \noverstate how integrated Canada, the US and Mexico \nwere up until the Trump administration began levying \ntariffs. Researchers say that a \nsingle part, such as an engine or \ntransmission, can cross these borders 7 or \n8 times. But its decision to allow \nChinese EVs has led President Trump to threaten \na 100% tariff on all Canadian goods and services. Canada's deal with China \nwill be a vehicle sized irritant on trade talks with \nthe US, said the head of the group \nthat represents Detroit automakers in the country. \nAmerican manufacturers make up only about 23% of \nCanadian auto production. Japanese makers Toyota and \nHonda make up the other 77%. Brian Kingston, \nwho is head of the group that represents GM, \nFord and Stellantis, told me that there are \nseveral reasons for this decline. The cyclical nature \nof the auto industry, the disruptions from the \ntrade talks, the retooling of plants for \nEVs. Kingston told me that Canada \nhas everything the US needs to pivot away from China, \nincluding every critical mineral needed for a next \ngeneration EV. It also has hydroelectric \nand nuclear power for factories."}, {"videoId": "OEKFXK0H8x4", "title": "What’s Inside The SAVE Act: Congress’ Voter ID Bill", "description": "In February Congress debated the SAVE Act which forces states to fortify voter ID requirements.

The purpose of the SAVE act \nis to ban non-citizens from voting in federal elections, \nand also to implement some kind of voter ID law where \nyou would have to show your driver's license when you go \nto cast a ballot. My name is Justin Papp. I \ncover politics for CNBC. So the initial version of \nthe SAVE act that Chip Roy introduced and Mike Lee \nintroduced in the Senate in late January, \nwould have required some form of ID at the ballot box \nthat proved you were an American citizen. So something like a \npassport, for instance. There was an \namended version of the SAVE act that was introduced over \nthe weekend that pairs that back a little bit. Some form of photo ID would \nstill be required at the polls to vote, \nbut the list of acceptable forms of ID is longer and \ncould include things like state issued IDs. Importantly, college IDs are \nstill prohibited under this amended version, \nwhich is a concern that many Democrats have that \nRepublicans are specifically targeting demographic \ngroups, including young people that \ntend to vote for Democrats. [Chuck Schumer] While the \nspecific policies may have changed since the days of \nthe Jim Crow South, the goal of the Save act is \nthe same disenfranchising American citizens and making \nit harder for eligible people to vote. More than 21 million \nAmericans don't have ready access to documents proving \nthat they're American citizens, and something like \nmore than 2 million people don't have a valid form of \ngovernment issued ID. Such as things like voter ID \nhave become more of a concern, particularly among \nRepublicans. Some states, mostly in the \nSouth, like North Carolina and \nMississippi, have implemented voter ID laws. Non-citizens are not allowed \nto vote in federal elections. But there are \ncertain territories like Washington, D.C. that allow \nthem to vote. Elections are mostly state \nrun. States can decide their own \nlaws around how they carry out elections. But \nconstitutionally, Congress does have a role in \nlegislating around how elections are carried out. [Donald Trump] You know, \nif you think about it, a state is an agent for the \nfederal government and elections. I don't know why \nthe federal government doesn't do them anyway. Trump just keeps banging \nthis drum about the prospect of non-citizens voting, \nand it sort of reached a fever pitch in the past \nseveral weeks. He's raised concerns about \nthe security of elections and about the prospect of \nnon-citizens voting in elections. It can happen. It does happen occasionally, but it is already illegal. And there are strict \npenalties for anybody who tries to vote if they're a \nnon-citizen. Fundamentally, most \nDemocrats do not agree with the concept of voter I.D., \nand so it's got a very difficult path to get to \nPresident Trump's desk. The Republican majority in \nthe Senate is slim. More than a handful of \nDemocrats would have to join their Republican colleagues \nand support the bill to get it over the 60 vote \nfilibuster threshold. My sense is they're trying \nto make this proposal more palatable to Democrats. There's been this massive \npressure campaign from the GOP, from influencers, \nfrom people like Elon Musk. In addition to Trump \nhimself, they continue to point to \npublic polling, which shows that the vast \nmajority of Americans are in support of at least the \nconcept of voter I.D.. But Democrats and voting \nrights groups say the devil is in the details. It's \nabout how those voting rights laws are written and \nwho they will potentially disenfranchise."}, {"videoId": "mT-W33o9Hh4", "title": "Amid Populist Shift, Some Democrats Are Urging A More Moderate Approach To Succeed In Midterms", "description": "A new report from the center-left New Democrat Coalition, shared exclusively with CNBC, lays out a roadmap for addressing affordability without splashy populist promises.

You have groups like \nprogressives, like Senator Elizabeth Warren, \nSenator Bernie Sanders, who have made headlines with \nbig, splashy populist proposals \nthat would really lower costs for a lot of \nAmericans. These movers and shakers \nwant the Democratic Party to respond to the 2024 losses \nby watering down our economic agenda and sucking \nup to the rich and powerful, claiming that a less \nprogressive Democratic party will win more elections. They are wrong. The New Democrat Coalition \nis a group of House Democrats, about 115 strong, that push for more moderate \nproposals than their populist counterparts. The goal of the coalition is \nto build a plan that sets itself apart from the \nprogressive left, but also sets itself apart \nfrom the Republicans and Donald Trump, \nthat would lower costs for everyday Americans. Polls show that's the number \none cost concern for the American people is lowering \nhealth care costs. But what about costs of \neveryday goods, including going to the \ngrocery store? People see how much the \nprices have increased. These tariffs have got to go \nand we are fighting to get rid of it. And what about \nenergy prices? That's another area that \npeople need to be thinking more about. We want to lower \nenergy prices by making sure that large \nusers of the grid pay their fair share, and that we have \ntrue accessibility to solar and wind alternative energy \nsources. That lowers energy prices. You won't find these big, \nsplashy proposals that are being proposed by senators \nlike Senator Elizabeth Warren or Senator Bernie \nSanders in this proposal, things like capping credit \ncard interest at 10% or taxing the rich at a much \nhigher rate than everyday Americans. What you will \nfind, though, are proposals that \nthe New Democrats say they can actually find common \nground on and pass to lower prices for Americans. The New Democrat coalition \nis targeting five areas to lower prices. Things like \ngroceries, things like health care, \nhousing, energy and families, \nthings like child care and elder care. They're talking \nabout cutting red tape for building housing. On energy, they're talking about \npermitting reform that might lower costs on utility \nbills, increasing biofuels, \nwhich could lower costs at the pump. And to do that, \nthey're talking about rolling back the tariffs \nthat President Trump has put into place, along with other \nthings like supporting small grocers and supporting small \nfarmers. New Democrats are going to \nfocus in on good public policy. Good public policy \nis good for the American people and good for \nbusiness. Lowering the health care \ncosts for the American people is ultimately good \nfor the economy. It puts more spending power \ninto the economy. We've seen the New Democrat \ncoalition strategy work well in recent elections for \ngovernor. Two Democrats, \nAbigail Spanberger and Mikie Sherrill, both won governors \nraces in their states on moderate platforms that are \nmore in line with what the New Democrat coalition is \nproposing than the progressive side of the \nDemocratic Party. There's a lot at stake for \nthe Democratic Party in the upcoming 2026 midterm \nelections, including whether they're \ngoing to take back power in Washington. We can only win this \nelection if independents and moderate Republicans want \nchange. They want to see elected \nofficials who will really fight to lower costs. And that's where the New \nDems come in. We can best appeal to \nindependents and moderate Republicans so that we can \ndeliver the majority to Congress for the American \npeople. This affordability idea has \nbecome a big liability for the incumbent Republican \nParty. Public polling has also \nindicated that President Donald Trump's approval \nrating on the economy, once a very strong issue for \nhim, has rapidly deteriorated. The president finds himself \nin the 30s on the economy, basically underwater. There is a percentage of the \npopulation that supports a lot of these more \nprogressive policies, especially in urban centers \nin northeast states, but we've never really seen \nthem catch on among the median voter.

Telehealth company Hims & \nHers announced a cheaper version of Novo's Wegovy \nweight-loss pill at the beginning of February. Now it would cost $49 to \nstart, which is far less than the \n$149 Novo sells the branded pill for. But it pulled the \ndrug after legal and regulatory risks escalated. Now, legally, \nthey're allowed to create a compounded version of a drug \nif they are saying they're adjusting the formula for \n\"personalized purposes.\" A legitimate example would be \nto mitigate side effects for patients by lowering \ncommercially available dosages. But Novo announced \nit will sue Hims over patent infringement. Novo argues \nthose compounded versions are no longer justified \nbecause semaglutide is no longer in a shortage in the \nU.S. Novo also says Hims crossed \nthe line from individualized compounding into what it \ncalls illegal mass compounding, producing \nstandardized versions at scale under the label of \npersonalization. Now, this is one of over 130 \nfederal lawsuits that have been filed by Novo Nordisk \nnationwide targeting pharmacies, telehealth \ncompanies, and others. Hims responded \nto Novo's complaint, writing on X this lawsuit \nattacks more than just one medication or company. It directly assaults a \nwell-established, vital component of U.S. pharmacy practice that has \nimproved patient care for everything from obesity to \ninfertility to cancer. On top of that, \nFDA Commissioner Marty Makary has weighed in on the \ndispute. He wrote on X, \nthe office will take action against mass marketing of \ndrugs that claim to be the same as the branded FDA \napproved drugs, and the FDA has also \nsignaled it could escalate enforcement, including \nrestricting access to key ingredients and referring \npotential violations to the Department of Justice. If you're in the market of \nproviding health care solutions to the public, \ndo so in a transparent way that the American public can \nrely upon. If you don't do that, \nwe're watching and we will make referrals as \nappropriate. The catch is, \nlegal grounds remain unclear to come after Hims directly \non that basis alone, an FDA crackdown sounds like \nregulators are about to shut down compounding altogether. But like I said, \ncompounding itself is legal and necessary when it's done \nfor individualized patient needs. Of course, \nHims and hers isn't the only telehealth provider in the \ngame. Ro is one example that folks have referenced as the \ngood actor in this case. They've actually been \ntransitioning a lot of patients from those early \ncompounded drugs when there was a drug shortage, \nto the branded drugs like what Novo Nordisk offers \nwith Wegovy and Ozempic. Compounding pharmacies are a \nsmall but visible part of the weight-loss drug market, valued at nearly $7 billion \nin 2025. They don't threaten Big \nPharma's core sales, but regulators could limit \ntheir ability to scale and market these drugs going \nforward. Novo estimates as many as \n1.5 million Americans are currently using compounded \nGLP-1 drugs, and the FDA's focus then \nturns to marketing, not compounding. Specifically, mass \nadvertising that makes compounded drugs sound \ninterchangeable with FDA approved products like \nWegovy. And that's why the FDA is \nwarning language has been careful. They're signaling \nenforcement around claims, not automatically around the \npharmacies or facilities making these drugs. This puts companies like \nHims in a tricky spot. The drug may be compounded \nat FDA registered facilities, but aggressive \nmarketing opens the door to regulatory action, \nand markets reacted to that uncertainty, with Hims stock \ndeclining on Monday after they pulled the oral version \nof the compound. These GLP-1 drugs can be big \nmoneymakers considering the demand, but the complicated \nweb of regulations surrounding them may be \nprohibitive for companies trying to lower the price.

Well, at least we know Peggy's not biased. While it's probably too early to say whether [music] or not BNY is the best at AI, we do know that the firm spent nearly $4 billion on technology [music] in 2025, about 19% of its total revenue. That's the highest proportion of its [music] large bank peers. >> There's an AI arms race. The banks are part of that. But you don't [music] define success by who spends the most. You define success by who has the best results. [music] BNY and almost every bank does not disclose benefits from AI. And I sometimes wonder whether it's [music] BNY or the industry if they even know their ROI, their return on investment. It's a lot of spraying and praying when it comes to spending on tech. Generally, >> Goldman Sachs's research team screened for companies in the Russell 1000 that would be the biggest beneficiaries from AI due to high labor costs that could be automated. BNY [music] ranks toward the top of the list with 19% earnings upside and that's why BNY is going allin. >> You guys are in this intense [music] AI session for 4 weeks which is super cool. >> This is BNY's AI boot camp. 40 hours of training mostly for non-engineers [music] and the goal find ways to automate their jobs. Boot camp participant [music] Ashoke Cherion is an attorney for the firm working to streamline his day-to-day. [music] The thing I'm working with the boot camp, the project is to create an agent that can generate a contract negotiation playbook. And that generally [music] used to take us like six to seven hours just to generate. So now it's becoming you can do it within, you know, 30 minutes. >> BNY is aiming to put 15,000 [music] of its employees through boot camp this year. It currently has 160 AI [music] solutions in production. >> We can certainly help build technology and engineering, but the great ideas are going to come from the practitioners [music] in the business. But I kept coming back to the obvious questions. Were the boot campers huddled in a lab together unknowingly coding [music] away their future job security? How many humans can and will be replaced by digital employees which work 24/7? >> I wouldn't [music] think about it that way. I I would think about it more as unlocking that productivity, enabling all [music] employees to be productive. >> Everyone I spoke with at BNY envisioned a future of the firm that still [music] relies on humans alongside machines. And this isn't the first time the centuries old company has had to contend with new technology. [music] Maybe I should have asked Eliza what she thinks."}]}
